#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run release preflight gates against the current checkout.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release/preflight.sh <subcommand>
#
# Subcommands:
#   drift         Branch drift: what main carries that dev never received (delegated to drift.sh)
#   surface       Establish surface: commits + diff vs last tag, breaking markers
#   smoke         Real-world live API / external dependency smoke (project-authored)
#   mechanics     Release mechanics sanity (version, lockfile, advisories, toolchain age, leak check,
#                 unguarded docs added to main, diff-B vs origin/dev)
#   all           Run drift, surface, smoke, mechanics (and surface-smoke if present)
#
# Post-tag verification (release.yml + homebrew dispatch + finalize-release) lives in
# scripts/release/postflight.sh — that runs AFTER the tag push, not before.
#
# Flags:
#   --smoke-home PATH   Reuse an existing seeded $SMOKE_HOME instead of creating + seeding
#   --no-cleanup        Keep $SMOKE_HOME after exit (default: shred on exit)
#   --tag TAG           Override LAST_TAG resolution (default: git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -n 1)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = all gates passed (or skipped with reason)
#   1 = one or more gates failed
#   2 = setup error (missing dep, unreachable secrets store, etc.)
#
# Dependencies:
#   - the built release binary (project decides how; Rust: cargo build --release)
#   - `gh`, `git` on PATH; `jaq`, `yq` if the project's gates need them
#   - 1Password CLI service-account env, if smoke gates seed from `secrets-dev`
#   - ~/.claude/skills/1password/scripts/ for vault reads (via _lib.sh's read_1p)
#
# This script is a starter skeleton vendored from ~/.claude/skills/github-repo-setup/.
# The shared scaffolding (gate helpers, 1Password reads, shred cleanup, dispatch, surface,
# mechanics) is generic; the smoke gate body is project-specific — replace the placeholder
# implementation with the project's actual API / auth / output-format checks.
